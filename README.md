ProtonMail Tweaks for v4 beta

## What does this do?
Adds some tweaks that fixes common annoyances such as padding issues.  

### Currently:  
- Decreases the padding between the navigation links on the left sidebar. A pet peeve of many.  
- Removes the "Empty Folder" button on the toolbar to prevent accidental deletion of countless emails. Unfortunately this also removes it from the Trash section at the moment.

## Requirements
A browser add-on that can alter the .css on any webpage.  
I recommened [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).  

## Installation
- Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)  
- Navigate to https://beta.protonmail.com  
- Click on the Stylus icon in your browser  
- Underneath `Write style for` highlight `beta.protonmail.com`  
- Paste the contents of `protontweaks.css`  
- Save
